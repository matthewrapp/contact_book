# Overview

As a software engineer, I understand the importance learning and understanding SQL databases and how relational databases work. I'm very familair with NoSQL, using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL cloud database service, but haven't had a chance to implement and learn much about relational databases.

That being said, I decided to program a simple software, a contact book, to help learn and implement SQL into an actual project.

# Relational Database

After doing some research, I decided to learn and implement Postgres into this project. I liked that it's a popular open-source relational database that a lot of companies are using in today's world. I also reaad that Postgres is a bit more difficult than MySQL, SQLite, etc., so I figured if I could learn Postgres, the other popular relation databases, would be easier for me to learn.

I added two tables. One Admin/User table, the person who owns the contact book and one contact table. The relationship is that one user can have multiple contacts, so a one to many relationship.

# Development Environment

#### Tools used to develop the software:

- VS Code
- Postgres
- pgAdmin
- Postman
- Terminal

#### Propgramming languages and libaries used:

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- npm
- psql (terminal-based front-end to Postgres)

# Future Work

- Adding more tables and relationships between those tables.
- Expanding on the functionality on the contact book application
  - Adding tags, categories, multiple ways of contacting (multiples emails, phone numbers, etc).
- Adding a delicate UI for people to use this software.
- Adding authentication to people signing up to use this software.
